TIMEOUTD 1.4 by Shane Alderton

Timeoutd is a programme which allows you to control the following
characteristics on a user by user and/or group by group basis for
each tty on your system:

- maximum idle time
- maximum time per session
- maximum time per day
- times when people can/can't login on specific ttys

To build timeoutd, you should make any changes to the makefile for
your preferred compilation options, then simply:

make

The next step is to install a timeouts file in /usr/etc specifying
the parameters for each line/user/group combination.  You can use
the sample file provided in the distribution as a starting point
after reading the timeoutd.8 and timeouts.5 man pages.

Once you have installed the timeouts file in /usr/etc, you can type:

make install

to install the timeoutd binaries and man pages.

Then it is just a matter of running /usr/etc/timeoutd.  You may want
to add a line to your /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local (or whatever) to run
timeoutd at boot time.

If you wish, you can also modify your login programme to have timeoutd
run at login time to check whether each user is allowed to login or not.
Otherwise, users who are not allowed to login will be logged off within
1 minute of logging in.

Another (albeit less certain) way of doing this is to put the following
line in /etc/profile near the top of the file:

/usr/etc/timeoutd `whoami` `basename \`tty\`` || exit
